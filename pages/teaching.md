#### [Public Health 142: Introduction to Probability and Statistics (Fall 2016)]({{BASE_PATH}})

Descriptive statistics, probability, probability distributions, point and
interval estimation, hypothesis testing, chi-square, correlation and regression
with biomedical applications.

#### [Public Health 242C: Longitudinal Data Analysis (Fall 2016)]({{BASE_PATH}}/)

The course covers the statistical issues surrounding estimation of effects using
data on subjects followed through time. The course emphasizes a regression model
approach and discusses disease incidence modeling and both continuous outcome
data/linear models and longitudinal extensions to nonlinear models (_e.g._,
logistic and Poisson). The primary focus is from the analysis side, but
mathematical intuition behind the procedures will also be discussed.

#### [Public Health 252D: Introduction to Causal Inference (Spring 2016)]({{BASE_PATH}})

This course presents a general framework for causal inference using directed
acyclic graphs, non-parametric structural equation models, and counterfactuals.
Marginal structural models and causal effect estimation using inverse
probability of treatment weighting, G-computation, and targeted maximum
likelihood are introduced. In two-part presentations, students will define and
implement research questions.
